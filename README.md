# Vectorizer.js

A naive JS implementation of a vectorization algorithm.

## How it works

You give a worker the image's data, and it returns an array of paths that form polygons of certain colors. Currently, everything is rectangular, so a round shape won't preserve it's roundness if you scale it.

## Roadmap
